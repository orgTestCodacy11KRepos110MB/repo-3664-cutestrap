        Documentation: Ion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ion was written using modern web technologies. The core of the library was written as a portable, reusable web application called Ion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rationale for writing fresh code is two-fold:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Build a lightweight solution to the two most common challenges in web development: Event Delegation and State Management.
          <ul><li>
            (We then crank these up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(Stranger_Things)">Eleven</a>.)
          </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Do it with zero dependencies outside of a modern web browser.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Browser Support: the most recent feature utilized is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">JavaScript Modules</a>. This leaves our support tail at Firefox 60, released 2018-05-09.
      </p>

      <h2>Event Delegation</h2>
      <p>
        Our event delegation is a thin wrapper around <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">addEventListener</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches">matches</a>. By combining the two, we get a single function call for delegating events to elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern web applications are expected to dynamically update content based on state changes. We've added a custom 'render' event to notify elements when the state changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also utilize a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a> under the hood. Using the same 'render' event, an element is also notified when itself is updated. This enables our HTML to become self-aware. Self-aware HTML is able to make external network requests based on the document. (And that's just one example!)
      </p>

      <h2>State Management</h2>
      <p>
        Our state management is backed by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a>. A string key is used to identify a piece of data within the storage mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to state will notify any callback functions that have been provided. This is how we notify elements that are listening for our 'render' event.
      </p>
